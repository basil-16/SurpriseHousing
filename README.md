# Surprise Housing 
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
> The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- Surprise housing wants to leverage the pwoer of ML to enhanec their returns

- My project will be used to understand how exactly prices will vary and then the company can accordingly devise a strategy to manage thier investments

## Conclusions
- GrLivArea highly influences the SalePrice higher the Area higher the SalePrice
- Quality of any variable indicating the quality should be excellent that will fetch the highest Sale Price but since that will be too expensive to maintain so the quality shouldnt dip below TA (Typical/Average)
- Neighborhood is also something that should be looked at although some extra data would be really useful about the neighnorhood for example crime rate, accidents etc
- Customers also tend to go for Garages which are attached to the house
- Materials used in the exterior of the hosue also plays a huge role in dertming the price of the property
- RoofStyles like Gable and Hit are often preferred although it boils down to thier personal opinion
